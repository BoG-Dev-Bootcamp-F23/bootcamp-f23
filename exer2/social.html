                            In my senior year of high school, I and a couple of other students developed a study website 
                            for some students taking a professional certification test that year. I also volunteered at a cybersecurity organization 
                            through my local college during my senior year of high school where I created and edited educational cybersecurity materials 
                            with the goal of educating students and by extension their friends and families in the area about how to stay safe online. Both of these positions provided me an opportunity to generate 
                            social good for people around me that I care about and for causes that I can passionately stand behind.
