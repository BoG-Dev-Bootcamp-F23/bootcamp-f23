                        In sophomore year of high school, I took two coding classes, one in C and one in C#. 
                        After that year, I took web design classes that gave me some experience with HTML, CSS, 
                        and JavaScript. After coming to college, I used Python through CS 1301 and Java through 
                        CS 1331. I recently gained a baseline knowledge of React.js concepts. Outside of languages, 
                        I have a couple of small projects like my rendition of Minesweeper in Python and my scientific
                        calculator, but my main project is my personal website that also has a clicker game embedded in it.
