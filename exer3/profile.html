                        <h3>Guitar Hero</h3>
                        <p>
                            When I was much younger, I used to watch my family and their friends play 
                            Guitar Hero 3, and when offered to play I never would. After a while of watching, 
                            and even learning to read from the games I finally picked up the guitar around when I 
                            was 5 years old. I've played ever since and branched out to several different Guitar Hero 
                            games and Guitar Hero adjacent games.

                        <h3>Overwatch</h3>
                        <p>
                            My main introduction into shooter games was Overwatch. Before this point, I 
                            primarily played Nintendo games and when I saw my friends playing Overwatch, I 
                            thought it looked like fun, so I got it. I played for years until Blizzard made 
                            several mistakes with the development of the game and it got ruined for me, and 
                            I've barely touched Overwatch 2.

                        <h3>Pokemon</h3>
                        <p>
                            Pokemon is probably one of my longest lasting interests in video games. I started 
                            with Pokemon Diamond when I was 6 and I've played Pokemon games through my whole life 
                            playing most of the main series games, excluding a lot of the earlier ones and I've explored 
                            lots of the side games like Pokemon Mystery Dungeon. However, I maintain that Pokemon Conquest 
                            is by far the best non main series Pokemon game.

                        This is Nathan Papa. He plays lots of different video games, 
                        and always has his whole life. He enjoys all differents kinds
                        of games, even League of Legends (and he hates that he does).
                        From Mario to Pokemon, Overwatch to Fortnite, League of Legends
                        to Valorant, and Osu! to Guitar Hero, he's enjoyed them all.
